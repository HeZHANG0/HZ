Parks and open spaces in cities are believed to have benefits on well-being of city residents. The psychological benefits of urban green infrastructure have been acknowledged by various studies. Thanks to social media, there is a source of disaggregated data to examine individual experience with regard to parks and open spaces (referred to as “parks” below): geo-tagged tweets. This exploratory project uses real-time streaming twitter data to correlate quantified sentiment inside/outside parks in San Francisco. It tries to answer the question: are people more positive when they are in parks compared to when they are not? Specifically, are people expressing more positively through Twitter when they are visiting parks? The result of this preliminary study answers “Yes” to this question. Further study using more extensive data and theoretical review of the use of tweets as indicator of spatiotemporal public expressed sentiment are required to dive deeper into this question.
